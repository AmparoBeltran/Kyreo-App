# Kyreo app - Acupuncture School App solution.

This is a progresive web app solution for an Acupuncture School based in Spain. This was a non profit project I designed and developed in order to help them build an interactive treatments database where the students can share their work experience, comment and help each other out. They can also upload projects, thesis etc.
